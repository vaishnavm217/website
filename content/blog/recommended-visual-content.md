Schindler's List is the living memorial of the horrors happened durinig holocaust. Inspired from real life story of Oskar Schindler, the whole movie grips you emotionally as you observe the atrocities and behaviour from both perspective as Nazi and Jew.Acting by Liam is phenomenal and the movie leaves a mark in your heart especially the ending.
